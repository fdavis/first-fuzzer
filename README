This is my first fuzzer based out of the Udacity class CS258.

Its intended use is:
1.  select the programs you wish to open files with
    and write them into the "apps" list in first_fuzzer.py
2.  use pull_files.py to bring files of a specific
    extension to the files/ directory
3.  run first_fuzzer.py
